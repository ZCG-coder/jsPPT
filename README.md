# jsPPT
A HTML app to display PowerPoint-like documents.

This app is in continuous development, and it is very basic now.

# How to run?
This app requires an HTTP (HTTPS is okay also) server to run.

(Using a server ensures `jQuery` loads correctly.)

The simplest way is using Python's `http.server`

A server will be created at `localhost:8000` by running
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Open `localhost:8000` in the browser to access the app.
